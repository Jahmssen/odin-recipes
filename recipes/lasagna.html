    <h3>A cheesy lasagna</h3>
    <p>We will need pasta, tomato sauce, and ground beef.</p>
    <p>This is my brother's favorite dish.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1/2 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1/2 (28 ounce) jar spaghetti sauce</li>
        <li>1 (14.5 ounce) can diced tomatoes</li>
        <li>1/2 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons dried basil (optional)</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons dried oregano (optional)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon black pepper</li>
        <li>2 cups dried mafalda noodles</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <h4>Step 1</h4><li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard grease. Add spaghetti sauce, tomatoes, onion, garlic, basil, oregano, salt, and pepper. Cook over low heat until sauce is hot, about 15 minutes.
        </li>
        <h4>Step 2</h4><li>Meanwhile, fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Cook mafalda noodles at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain.

        </li>
        <h4>Step 3</h4><li>Add cooked and drained noodles to the sauce and stir until completely coated. Sprinkle mozzarella cheese on top.

        </li>
        <h4>Step 4</h4><li>Set an oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler.

        </li>
        <h4>Step 5</h4><li>Place skillet under the hot broil and cook until cheese is golden and bubbly, 3 to 5 minutes.

        </li>
    </ol>
